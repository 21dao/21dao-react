# 21dao

This is the frontend for the 21dao website. The 21dao is a not for profit dao that supports artists and art on the Solana blockchain. Decisions are made by voting/council members of the dao.

## Updating Artists

The primary artist data is stored in a json file while auction and listing data is queried from the 21dao-api. To update the artist data edit src/data/artists/artists.json

## Auction and listing data

Auction and listing data is sourced from Exchange.Art, Formfunction and Holaplex.

## Reuse
